# Notice

1. I use backticks, everywhere
    It doesn't use any extra resources,
    It doesn't require using more than one quote,
    I don't have to escape " or ',
    I can use template litlerals whenever I want.

2. I use my own command handler
    It lets me share commands and events between my bots
    so I don't have as much duplicated code to update.

3. I use `__` directory names
    I do this to keep folders in the right order in my editor.
    `__Global` Is for all the global files that my bots share.
    `__base` Is a template folder to make a new bot.

4. I don't use semicolons `;`
    Don't like it don't look at the repo.

More coming soon...
